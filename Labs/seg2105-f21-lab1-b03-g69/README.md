Lab 1 Part 1:
- hayat.txt
- juan.txt
- leah.txt
- nakul.txt
- satrajit.txt
Committed and pushed to repository by each member.

Lab 1 Part 2:
- team.txt
Initially committed and pushed to repository by Juan. The following steps were done by the other 4 members after receiving a conflict warning:
1. *** git pull https://github.com/SEG2105-uottawa/seg2105-f21-lab1-b03-g69.git
2. After pulling the updated repository, each member edited team.txt to add their name to the file.
3. *** git add team.txt
4. *** git commit -m "message"
5. Leah edited team.txt around the same time as Satrajit, but did not do a second git pull to update the working repository. 
   A second conflict warning occurred, and steps 1-4 were repeated.
6. *** git push origin main
