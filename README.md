# Project

Students were tasked with designing a mobile application for a fictional car rental service. The application required for an administrator account, branch (employee) accounts, and customer accounts. The user must be able to register a branch account or a customer account, and login to any existing account if the login credentials are correct. The admin must be able to create, edit and delete services provided by the service company and delete branch/customer accounts. Branch accounts must be able to receive, accept, and reject service requests from customers, and edit the information about the branch (such as address, working hours, services offered at that specific branch). Customer accounts must be able to search for branches by address, services provided, or working hours, then request services from a selected branch.
